ent-SpawnPointGhostBlob = Blob
    .suffix = Spawner
    .desc = { ent-MarkerBase.desc }
ent-MobBlobPod = Blob pod
    .desc = An ordinary person fighting opponents, not like a thing attached to a tile, zombifies corpses.
ent-MobBlobBlobbernaut = Blobbernaut
    .desc = Juggernaut, but blob! when the station crew shows full hatred of you, with the help of such strong men you can organize a blitzkriek if you tell them the plan in advance.
ent-BaseBlob = base blob
    .desc = { "" }
ent-NormalBlobTile = Normal Blob
    .desc = An ordinary part of yours required for the construction of more advanced tiles.
ent-CoreBlobTile = Core Blob
    .desc = The most important part of you. This is the brain and heart of the Blob. You cannot have more than one core (if you have a second one, it is not controlled by you), so you must protect it at all costs, otherwise you will die. The core itself restores health over time; with the regenerative chemical, health is restored 10 times faster. The core produces FIVE resource points per two seconds.
ent-CoreBlobTileGhostRole = { ent-CoreBlobTile }
    .suffix = Ghost Role
    .desc = { ent-CoreBlobTile.desc }
ent-FactoryBlobTile = Factory Blob
    .desc = The so-called BlobPods come out of the factory and attack passers-by and zombify the corpses of these same passers-by. One factory produces 3 of these BlobPods; they cannot be placed next to each other at a distance of 7 tiles; one factory can produce only one Blobbernaut.
ent-ResourceBlobTile = Resource Blob
    .desc = { ent-BaseBlob.desc }
ent-NodeBlobTile = Node Blob
    .desc = The second, but mini, Blob core, near which you can place factories and resource blobs. Required to split the core.
ent-StrongBlobTile = StrongBlobTile
    .desc = The basis of defensive positions has not only a strength of 6 times, this tile is also capable of withstanding various gases in order to become an atmospheric technician to protect the core, for example, from plasma that the enemy can set on fire.
ent-ReflectiveBlobTile = ReflectiveBlobTile
    .desc = Upgrading a fortified cell in which they pay less strength for the ability to reflect only energy projectiles and lasers with a 90% chance.
ent-MobObserverBlobController = Blob observer controller
    .desc = { "" }
ent-MobObserverBlob = Blob observer
    .desc = { "" }
