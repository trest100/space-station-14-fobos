Preamble

Upon receipt of a copy of the licensed work (the "Build") by any means, any person may use it 
only if they accept and agree to all the terms of this License Agreement ("Agreement"). 
Violation of the Agreement grants the Licensor the right to take legal and technological measures, 
including but not limited to the DMCA or other applicable laws in the jurisdictions where 
hosting providers and information intermediaries are located.

By accepting the terms of this Agreement, the Licensee enters into a non-exclusive, 
royalty-free license agreement with Мёртвый Космос ("Licensor"). The Agreement does not include 
provisions regulating issues related to the processing of personal data.

Definitions

Build: The object of Agreement, the result of the original author's work or a team of 
authors, a complex intellectual property object – a video game that includes, but is not 
limited to, source, object code, tools, game assets, specifications, UI/UX design, elements 
of narrative and other creative content based on the revision and translation into Russian of 
the open version of Space Station 14 and the artistic vision of the authors. 
The set of individual elements is a Build. Any elements other than the original elements are 
objects of copyright and/or related rights created by the creative work of the collective.

Contribution: Any original author's work of Contributors, including any 
modifications or additions to the Build (any source code, object code, correction, tool, 
sample, graphics, assets, specifications, manuals, documentation), which is intentionally 
provided by the Licensee to the Licensor. For the purposes of this definition, 
submission means any form of electronic, oral or written communication sent to Licensor 
or its representatives, including, but not limited to, messages on electronic mailing lists, 
source code control systems and issue tracking systems operated by or on behalf of the 
Licensor for the purposes of discussing or improving software or project documentation 
and source. Communications for which it is explicitly stated in writing as "Not a 
Contribution" will not be considered a Contribution. When providing a Contribution to the 
Build, the Contributor grants the Licensor a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable 
license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense their Contributions. The Contributor retains 
the copyright and the right to use their Contribution in other projects, provided that such use 
does not involve direct reproduction of substantial portions of the Build or create derivative 
works that misrepresent affiliation with the Build.

Licensor: The designated representative of the "Мёртвый Космос" community. For legal and technical 
inquiries, contact: deadspace14.contact@gmail.com.

Scope of Granted Rights

The license grants an unlimited number of persons the right to copy and make changes 
solely for the purpose of improving the game and subject to the further transfer of such 
changes to Мёртвый Космос on the terms of the Contribution, as well as for non-public hosting and 
launching the Build on the Licensee's computer for the purpose of non-commercial use 
for its intended purpose (providing access to Players and the Game process). This license 
expressly prohibits commercial use, public hosting, as well as non-licensed use. The use 
of the Build or its elements in violation of the terms of this License grants the Licensor 
the right to contact the hosting provider and other persons – information intermediaries 
to block hosting. The Licensee may publicly host the Build only if they receive direct permission 
from the Licensor.

License Compatibility & Asset Licensing

The original Space Station 14 code remains subject to the MIT License and is not restricted by this Agreement.
Individual elements of the Build (graphics, sounds, source code) may be distributed under 
a license other than this one. Most assets are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 unless otherwise 
specified. Assets have their own license and copyright in the metadata file.
